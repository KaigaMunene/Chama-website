      "It was an incredible experience—truly the definition of overcoming your fears. One of my most memorable moments was in class when I mentioned how I didn’t like the sound of my own voice through a speaker. In the middle of explaining this, Kalekye interrupted, handed me the mic, and asked me to continue sharing why I felt that way. As I spoke, I could hear my voice through the speaker and, gradually, I became more comfortable with it. By the time I finished, I had completely moved past my discomfort. Once you realize that it's not 'magic' but a skill you develop, it becomes as easy as a walk in the park.",

The individualized attention, fun learning environment, and well-structured sessions have helped me expand my knowledge and improve my skills in voice-over work.

      "OYM - The voice Over program has been incredible. A course that I would still like to further with KM network. I liked the classroom interactions between the teacher and us. I felt accommodated and although I was new to voiceover's I learned and developed more interest in the field. Learning how to do the voiceover was not easy, but it's worth it at the end of the day. There's much I can say about this program. Generally, I am happy and satisfied with what was offered to me. I am a step higher.",
